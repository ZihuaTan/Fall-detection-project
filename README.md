# Fall-detection-project
Designed a fall detection project using machine learning.
# Introduction
A fall detection project using Tensorflow Object Detection API, Openpose and OpenCV.
The project is able to read an image that is captured from web camera. Then the image will go through a machine learning model to determine whether the person in the image is standing， seating or lying. After that, the image will be processed by Openpose to generate the join keypoints of the human being. These join keypoints will be used to do the fall detection or mark the ground area of the image.
