# Fall-detection-project
Designed a fall detection project using machine learning.
# Introduction
A fall detection project using Tensorflow Object Detection API, Openpose and OpenCV.
The project will be read an image that is captured from web camera. Then the image will go through a machine learning model to determine whether the person in the image is standingï¼Œ seating or lying. After that, the image will be processed by Openpose to generate the join keypoints of the human being. These join keypoints will be used to do the fall detection or mark the ground area of the image.
## Project details: step by step
1. The web camera will captured a picture and store the pictrue to the local assigned foloder. Then the image will be process by a trained machine learning model to detect the posture of the human being in the image.
